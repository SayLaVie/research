 ---Notes from meeting with LeGrand---
Start with a simple agent
   1 layer neural network
Don't worry about a global 'best player'
   Allow the genetic algorithm to move around
   Trust that it consistently finds local optima
Our meetings will be Fridays at 4pm - 5pm


---Neural Network---
I need a perceptron that takes in one input per hex on the board
   The perceptron will output a value between (-n) and (n)
   The greater the value returned, the better the board position is
<Note> A single layer neural network will only be able to prioritize square locations
   e.g. Hexes in the middle of the board are more desirable
