 ---Notes from meeting with LeGrand (over summer)---
Start with a simple agent
   1 layer neural network
Don't worry about a global 'best player'
   Allow the genetic algorithm to move around
   Trust that it consistently finds local optima
Our meetings will be Fridays at 4pm - 5pm


Reference to hex-game code found on github
   The way the set up their board is different from me
      They use bitwise operators (| and &) to determine connectivity, somehow
      They seem to have multiple boards, for each player maybe?


Idea for grouping tiles together for evaluation:
   Dr. LeGrand mentioned feeding perceptrons the state of a group of tiles (instead of individual tiles)
   to make the neural nets more flexible. Here's an idea:
      Look at a subgraph of size 3x3, and determine if it is winnable assuming two perfect players(mini-max)
      The results of each of these sub-games will be an input into the neural net
