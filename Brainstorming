 ---Notes from meeting with LeGrand---
Start with a simple agent
   1 layer neural network
Don't worry about a global 'best player'
   Allow the genetic algorithm to move around
   Trust that it consistently finds local optima
Our meetings will be Fridays at 4pm - 5pm


---Neural Network---
I need a perceptron that takes in one input per hex on the board
   The perceptron will output a value between (-n) and (n)
   The greater the value returned, the better the board position is
<Note> A single layer neural network will only be able to prioritize square locations
   e.g. Hexes in the middle of the board are more desirable



---Thoughts---
Will the genetic algorithm be fundamentally the same for many layer networks?


---Plans---
Create a class for each player. The Genetic algorithm can create an object and pass
it the new weights that were determined from the evolution.
Games can be played between players
   -- This requires changed the layout of the code I already have.



Genetic Algorithm as Mother -- Top layer
   Mother creates children who play with each other
      (create instances of HexPlayer class which includes
      preceptrons within them - all that's needed is a set of weights)
   We're able to rank the children based on how they play
      - Perhaps we will program a known 'good' player and use W/L statistics to compare
   We breed them to get new children
   etc...
~ If I choose this method, I will have to re-write a lot of code. This may be the best option, though
- I'll still need a benchmark agent to play against -- for size 3, we can have a perfect player
How do I want to manage displaying results? Same as what we did for our project?
