# To Do
- implement neural net in neuralNetHeuristic
- devise function to set weights for neural net (this is where the topology of the net will be set)
	- maybe create new directory to contain different net topologies (specific maps could be chosen at compilation, or at beginning of execution via stdin prompt)
- design/implement main function
	- neighborhood of hex players
- implement genetic algorithm
- devise hardness scale
- Save/Resume function
   - via command line arguments
   - via user interaction during execution
