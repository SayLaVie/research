# To Do
- maybe create new directory to contain different net topologies (specific maps could be chosen at compilation, or at beginning 	of execution via stdin prompt)
- devise hardness scale
- Save/Resume function
   - via command line arguments
   - via user interaction during execution
- Seperate main function to test progress so far
