#### Research Description
*Hex* is a two-player adversarial board game in which there is always exactly one winner. We create game-playing agents that use feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks to make evaluations of the board-state at any given point in the game, and use a genetic algorithm to teach the agents to imporve the accuracy of their evaluations.
