   Quotable Things:
"Computers have solved all 9x9 1-move openings and two 10x10 1-move openings..."(pg. 2)

"Another challenge is that the reward signal in Hex occurs only at the end of a
game, so (with respect to move actions) is infrequent, meaning that most updates
are  based  only  on  network  evaluations  without  immediate  win/loss  feedback" (pg. 3)

"The state of the Hex board is encoded as a 3 dimensional array with 2 spatial
dimensions and 6 channels as follows: white stone present;   black stone present;
white stone group connected to left edge;   white stone group connected to right
edge;    black stone group connected to top edge;    black stone group connected
to bottom edge." (pg. 6)

"Our  network  consists  of  10  convolutional  layers  followed  by  one
fully connected output layer."(pg. 7)




   Reading Notes
- Motivated by DeepMind's (Google) recent success with Go.

- Q-learning ... earns a mapping from states to action
values by backing up action value estimates from subsequent states to improve
those in previous states

- Experience replay stores agent experiences in memory and sampling from these experiences to perform updates

- This work applies the Deep Q-learning with Experience Replay to Hex

- They have a move complicated board-state
   The state of the Hex board is encoded as a 3 dimensional array with 2 spatial
dimensions and 6 channels as follows: white stone present;   black stone present;
white stone group connected to left edge;   white stone group connected to right
edge;    black stone group connected to top edge;    black stone group connected
to bottom edge.

   Quotable Things:
"SPDFPN solved all previously intractable 9×9 Hex opening moves; the hardest opening took 111 days. Also, in 63 days, it solved one10×10 Hex opening move. This is the first time a computer or human has solveda 10×10 Hex opening move" (pg. 1)
