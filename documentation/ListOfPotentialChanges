This is a list of potential variables we can adjust throughout the research process.

- depth limit
- board size
- shape of neural net
- method of board-state input (chunking, etc...)
- distribution model (randomizers)
- evolution (how to pass on genes)
- shape of hex world
- how rare evolution is
   - How much should it vary by?
