This is a list of potential variables we can adjust throughout the research process. This will also be referenced for future works.

- depth limit
- board size
- size of population
- shape of neural net
- what aspects of gameplay is the ANN aware of
	- Currently aware of move validity
- method of board-state input
	- Chunking
	- Whether a tile is connected to a side
- distribution model (which RNG's to use)
- evolution (how to pass on genes)
- shape of hex world
- How rare mutation is
   - How much does mutation vary? (standard deviation)
- Is the coin toss biased?
- Information to be considered in the fitness function
   - numMovesMade during game
- Copies instead of Swaps (in swappingStrategy)
- Inertia
   - Whether or not we bias keeping one's own genes
