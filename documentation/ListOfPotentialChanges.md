This is a list of potential variables we can adjust throughout the research process.

- depth limit
- board size
- size of population
- shape of neural net
- method of board-state input (chunking, etc...)
- distribution model (which RNG's to use)
- evolution (how to pass on genes)
- shape of hex world
- How rare mutation is
   - How much does mutation vary? (standard deviation)
- Is the coin toss biased?
- Information to be considered in the fitness function
   - numMovesMade during game
