- The internet tells me that using <cstdlib>'s random is not as 'random'
as using c++11's <random> library. Should I care?

- Choosing the random distribution
   I have currently chosen exponential_distribution, as it seems to weigh nicely towards 0 (with 3.5 as input)
   Other distributions of note:
      lognormal_distribution
      fisher_f_distribution
      piecewise_linear_distribution

- When using the discrete_distribtution for breeding, should I use a vector? (to keep track of objects created, etc...)
  !- maybe write a function, so that each instance of the generator is destroyed after calling

- Maybe I should create a class that keeps track of the info of each individual game
   - Player who won, number of moves that each player took, etc...
