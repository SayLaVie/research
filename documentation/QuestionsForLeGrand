- Choosing the random distribution
   I have currently chosen exponential_distribution, as it seems to weigh nicely towards 0 (with 3.5 as input)
   Other distributions of note:
      lognormal_distribution
      fisher_f_distribution
      piecewise_linear_distribution

- When using the discrete_distribtution for breeding, should I use a vector? (to keep track of objects created, etc...)
  !- maybe write a function, so that each instance of the generator is destroyed after calling

- Maybe I should create a class that keeps track of the info of each individual game
   - Player who won, number of moves that each player took, etc...

- (Future) I can make global variables externs, so that I can set them from command line

- I need to make a main function that only tests the functions I've created

- Const questions??

- Currently, I'm seeding with seconds since epoch. Should I do milliseconds?

- Github progress?

- AI as a career: Do I need grad school?

- How to handle mutation?

- Complicated nets, where not every input feeds into the next?

- Blondie24 kept the winningest parents.
