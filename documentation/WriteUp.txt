Evolving a Hex-Playing Agent

Intro with related work

Hex is an adversarial board game in which there is always exactly one winner. The game was invented in 1942 by Piet Hein, and independently reinvented in 1948 by John Nash. The board is in the shape of an nxn parralelogram and is made up of nxn hexagon shaped tiles. Each player has a store of tiles, colored differently than their opponent's. Players alternate placing tiles on the hexagons of the board, capturing that hexagon. The goal of the game is for a player to connect opposing sides of the board. The sides of the board each player is aiming to connect is determined before the game starts. See Figure 1 below for an example of a completed game. John Nash offered an existence proof in 1949 of a first-player advantage in the game, but no general winning strategy exists for the game (Gardner).

Research into Hex is often concerning with solving the game. Here, solving generally means finding perfect moves that give the player a guaranteed win. Levels of 'solved' vary from knowing only the best first move (weakly solved), to knowing the best move at all points in the game (strongly solved). As of 2011, humans have only been able to solve some center moves weakly for boards sized 8x8 and 9x9 (Beyond Humans). In 2014, Pawlewicz and Hayward developed a Scalable Parallel DFPN Search and used it to solve all previously intractable 9x9 openings and one 10x10 opening. The hardest 9x9 opening took 111 days (Scalable Parallel DFPN Search).

Because perfectly solving

An exhaustive search with a minimax style algorithm yields perfect play, but the running time of such a search increases exponentially as board sizes grow.


The purpose of this research is to:
   1) Create a strong Hex player that relies on an ANN (artificial neural network) to make evaluations of the state of a Hex board during any stage of play, so that minimax search strategies can be bypassed entirely.
   2) Evaluate the effects of the size and shape of ANN on the ability of the ANN to learn board evaluation
   3) Evaluate the effects of the evolutionary strategies of the genetic algorithm on the ability of the ANN to learn board evaluation

Similar research to ours exists. Young, Vasan, and Hayward used Deep Q-learning and self-play to train a CNN (convolutional neural network) to play Hex on a 13x13 board with no search. One key difference between our studies is that Young, Vasan, and Hayward began their experiment with supervised training of their agent on a database of games. Our experiment is completely unsupervised. David Fogel used a similar approach to ours to teach an ANN to play checkers, as published in his book 'Blondie 24'. His algorithm was also completely unsupervised, but it still utilized a depth-limited minimax search.
